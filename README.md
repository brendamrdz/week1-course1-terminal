## What is a terminal?
This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell.

## Command line (Shell)
The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.

### Types of Shells

## Wildcards
Commands can use wildcards to perform actions on more than one file at a time.

|    | Here is the basic set of wildcards: |
|----|-------------------------------------|
| *  | represents zero or more characters  |
| ?  | represents a single character       |
| [] | represents a range of characters    |

### Examples

Displays all those files that have the word data in the file name.

```bash
ls data*
```
Displays all those files that have the word data and end with a characters in the file name.

```bash
ls datos?
```
Displays all those directories that start with lowercase and uppercase
```bash
ls -d [[:upper:]] 
```
```bash
ls -d[[:lower:]] 
```

## How does the shell works
![how does the shell works](https://github.com/brendamrdz/week1-course1-terminal/blob/main/images/Picture1.png?raw=true)
### Pipe operator
The pipe character redirects the standard output from one command to the standard input of another command. 
```bash
ls -lh | less
```
### Redirecting Standard Output
The greater-than (>) metacharacter directs the standard output to a file instead of printing the output to the screen.
```bash
ls Pictures > myPictures.txt
```
### Redirecting Standard Error
A command using the file descriptor number (2) and the greater-than (>) sign redirects any standard error messages to the /dev/null file.
```bash
less file.tst 2> /dev/null
```
## Control Operators
| Control Operator              | Usage                                                                                                                                    | Syntax                     |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| ;semicolon                    | Semicolon is used for separation of two or more commands on a single line of command prompt.                                              | echo Hello ; echo World    |
| & ampersand                   | The execution of command takes place in the background of the command prompt. It shows full result after completion of full process in the background. | echo Hello World &         |
| && double ampersand           | In this case this operator checks if the first condition is true then only the second will execute.                                           | echo Hello && echo World   |
| || double vertical bar      | Double vertical bar is used as OR logical operators that check two commands. In this case the operator check both conditions.            | echo Hello || echo World |
## How to manage permissions
The permissions control the actions that can be performed on the file or directory. They either permit, or prevent, a file from being read, modified or, if it is a script or program, executed. 
* chmod command modifies Linux file permissions

Types of mode
- Owner
- Group
- World

| SYMBOLIC MODE | TYPES OF MODES     |
|---------------|-----------|
| u             | user      |
| e             | group     |
| o             | world     |
| a             | all modes |

### Change permissions example
Remove permission from a user to read
```bash
chmod u-r nameFile.txt
```
Add read permission for a user to read
```bash
chmod u+r nameFile.txt
```
